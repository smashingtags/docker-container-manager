# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Docker container management platform similar to Unraid's Docker functionality. The system provides a web-based interface for managing Docker containers with an app store-like experience for discovering, installing, and configuring containerized applications. Users can browse available applications, deploy them with custom configurations, and manage their lifecycle through an intuitive dashboard.

The system is designed to run on Linux-based systems with Docker installed, providing a self-hosted solution that can be deployed on home servers, VPS instances, or dedicated hardware. The web interface will be accessible from any device on the network, making it suitable for both personal and small business use cases.

The architecture emphasizes modularity and extensibility, using modern development practices with a minimalist coding approach. The system should be built with a plugin-like structure that allows new features to be added incrementally without requiring major refactoring of existing components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to browse available Docker applications in an app store interface, so that I can easily discover and deploy containerized services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the app store THEN the system SHALL display a categorized list of available Docker applications
2. WHEN the user searches for applications THEN the system SHALL filter results based on name, description, and tags
3. WHEN the user views an application THEN the system SHALL display application details including description, version, resource requirements, and configuration options
4. WHEN the user selects an application THEN the system SHALL provide installation options with customizable parameters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy Docker containers with custom configurations, so that I can tailor applications to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates container deployment THEN the system SHALL present a configuration form with environment variables, port mappings, and volume mounts
2. WHEN the user submits valid configuration THEN the system SHALL create and start the Docker container with specified settings
3. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent deployment
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful container creation and provide access details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage running containers through a dashboard, so that I can monitor and control my deployed applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all containers with their current status, resource usage, and basic information
2. WHEN the user selects a container THEN the system SHALL provide options to start, stop, restart, or remove the container
3. WHEN the user performs container actions THEN the system SHALL execute the action and update the container status in real-time
4. WHEN the user views container details THEN the system SHALL display logs, configuration, and performance metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure container networking and storage, so that I can integrate containers with my existing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user configures a container THEN the system SHALL allow specification of port mappings between host and container
2. WHEN the user sets up storage THEN the system SHALL support volume mounts for persistent data
3. WHEN the user configures networking THEN the system SHALL allow selection of Docker networks and custom network settings
4. IF network or storage conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and display conflict details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to update and maintain containers, so that I can keep my applications secure and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updates are available THEN the system SHALL notify users of container image updates
2. WHEN the user initiates an update THEN the system SHALL pull the new image and recreate the container with existing configuration
3. WHEN the user backs up configurations THEN the system SHALL export container settings for restoration
4. WHEN the user restores configurations THEN the system SHALL recreate containers from exported settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor container performance and logs, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views container metrics THEN the system SHALL display CPU, memory, network, and disk usage statistics
2. WHEN the user accesses logs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time and historical container log viewing
3. WHEN the user sets up alerts THEN the system SHALL notify when containers exceed resource thresholds or fail health checks
4. WHEN the user exports logs THEN the system SHALL provide log download functionality for external analysis

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have a modular architecture, so that new features can be added without disrupting existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are developed THEN the system SHALL support plugin-like extensions without requiring core system modifications
2. WHEN components are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically discover and load available modules
4. WHEN modules are disabled THEN the system SHALL continue operating with remaining functionality intact
